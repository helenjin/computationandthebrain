#### First Draft of Project Update



To build the Spiking Neural Network (SNN), we will incorporate many of these Hodgkin-Huxley models for neurons in the structure consisting of two (and later three) hidden layers. To train the SNN, we have decided to try SpikeProp first. SpikeProp assumes that each neuron in the network fires exactly once during the simulation interval.
